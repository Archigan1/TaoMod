<TEST IDEAS>
Some kind of Thruster flamethrower; possibly crafted with the other 2 early-HM ores??? 
Can also be biome-themed; ideas:
- Corruption; Shoots 3 thin columns of cursed flames with regular recoil
- Crimson; Shoots flaming ichor blobs that explode into smaller ichor blobs with high recoil and low firerate
- Hallow; Shoots hallowed sparks that have extremely low recoil but low damage
- Mushroom; Puffs out fungus clouds that pierce and linger with average recoil
- Gel; Shoots a small ranged flame with average recoil

Hallowed Mortar that shoots shells that will attempt to soar up and then fall down with an arc at your cursor.
Shells can explode by hitting any block during any state. Creates a player sized explosion that shoots 4-5 frags 
off that do 25% of the base damage. Inflicts On Fire. Mortar appears on back.
